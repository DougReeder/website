<h2>Register now!</h2>
Since this unconference is unorganized, registration is simply through <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/unhosted">its lanyrd page</a>.
<h2>Venue</h2>
Unho&#353;&#357; is a historical village with about 3000 inhabitants, which because of its unique location in the hills of Central Bohemia, its cheap local food and beer, and of course its appropriate name, is the target of a (now) yearly pilgrimage of unhosted web app developers. See the <a href="http://www.webcams.travel/webcam/1299307479-Weather-Unho%C5%A1%C5%A5-Unho%C5%A1%C5%A5">Unho&#353;&#357; webcam</a> for a live weather check. It's 10km west of Prague airport, so you could get a taxi, or if not you can also take bus line 307 which leaves between 1 and 3 times an hour from the west-most stop of Prague's yellow metro line, Zlicin. Last year we used Hotel Galerie as the venue, but that has sadly been turned into an old people's home. Luckily though we spotted Pension Irena, and it's the perfect venue. Rooms are cheap, there is free wifi throughout, and a nice garden. There is also a posh hotel with a golf course 3km down the road in an even smaller village called (I kid you not) Unho&#353;&#357; Amerika.
