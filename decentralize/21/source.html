<!-- sessions: origins, OAuth, and WebIntents -->
<h3>Client-side sessions</h3>
<p>Last week we looked at how you can manage your login-identity when you do your computing on multiple servers and/or multiple clients.
Sessions turned out to play a significant role in this, because they can link the current user on a client to a current user on a server, and remove this link
when the user on the client finishes the session. This way, you only have to establish trust once, and can then use the remote server without any further login prompts.</p>
<p>This week we'll look a bit more closely into this concept, especially in relation to client-side applications. Because web browsers have a (sandboxed) way of retrieving
source code from a remote server, and then running it client-side, it is possible to establish a session that stays within this sandbox, and does not exist on the server
that served up the web app.</p>
<p>This is, in my view, <em>the</em> core concept of unhosted web apps. Sorry we had to get to episode 21 before I bring it up. :)
With client-side sessions, the server serves up the source code of an application, instead of serving up its user interface.
This means no server-side session is established. The website is served up in a stateless, RESTful way, as static content. But once the web app's html, css, and javascript
code have reached the client-side, it "comes to life", that is, it starts to behave dynamically.</p>
<p>Behaving dynamically is of course again a vague term, but it definitely implies that the application's output cannot be mapped one-to-one to the user's latest action.
A rudimentary form of client-side dynamic behavior is for instance a <code>textarea</code> element that builds up a text in response to consecutive keystrokes. Unless
the app puts the entire current state into the URL, the app has "client-side state", and its behavior can be called dynamic.</p>
<p>When there is no server-side session, a lot of things change. Most web developers have formed their brain by thinking in terms of the LAMP stack and similar server-side
frameworks, and it was only in recent years that people started to make the paradigm shift to thinking about client-side sessions.
For instance, OAuth did not have a client-side flow before 2010, and the webfinger spec has only mentioned CORS headers since 2011. </p>

<h3>Web app origins</h3>
<p>Even if the code runs on the client-side, the trust model of the web stay based on origins: depending on the server that hosted the code that has been loaded into
the current browser tab (the 'host', or 'origin' of the web app), it may interact with other pieces of code in the same and other tabs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript">same-origin policy</a> describes the exact rules for
this. For instance, a web app is often not allowed to include <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2013/04/10/mixed-content-blocking-enabled-in-firefox-23/">mixed content</a>,
the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/X-Frame-Options">X-Frame-Options</a> header can restrict iframing, and technologies like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.postMessage">window.postMessage</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Storage">DOM storage</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers">Web workers</a> are also usually sandboxed by script origin.</p>
<p>For data URIs, file: URLs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklets</a>, you can get into all sorts of edge-cases. For instance,
  <a href="javascript:alert(location.host);">this bookmarklet</a> inherits the scope of the page you're on when you click it, but
  <a href="javascript:location='data:text/html,%3Cscript%3Ealert(location.host)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E'">this one</a> will execute parent-less,
  with the empty string as its origin, because it was encapsulated into a redirection.</p>
<p>Another way to reach the empty origin from a bookmarklet is to become a hyperlink and click yourself. :)
  Don't try this at home though, I'm only mentioning this for entertainment value. In general, your unhosted web apps should always have a unique URL that starts with
  <code>https://</code>.</p>
