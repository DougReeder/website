<h3>URLs, DNS, and DNR</h3>
<p>The DNS system is a distributed (but centralized) database that maps easy-to-remember domain names onto hard-to-remember IP addresses. In the process, it provides
a level of indirection whereby the IP address of a given service may change while domain name stays the same.</p>
<p>These two characteristics make DNS+HTTPS the perfect basis for weaving together hypertext documents. One downside of DNS is that it is subject to attacks from
  (especially) nation state governments. Another is that registering a domain name costs money. The money you pay for a domain name is not so much a contribution to
  the cost of running the world's DNS infrastructure, but more a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">proof-of-work</a> threshold which curbs domain name squatting to some extent. If registering a domain name
  were cheaper, then it would be even harder to find a domain name that is not yet taken.</p>
