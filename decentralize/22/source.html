<!-- search: How to locate resources -->
<p>Last week, Adrian reminded me that there should be an episode about search. So, here goes! :)</p>

<h3>URLs, DNS, and DNR</h3>
<p>The DNS system is a distributed (but centralized) database that maps easy-to-remember domain names onto hard-to-remember IP addresses. In the process, it provides
a level of indirection whereby the IP address of a given service may change while domain name stays the same.</p>
<p>These two characteristics make DNS+HTTPS the perfect basis for weaving together hypertext documents. One downside of DNS is that it is subject to attacks from
  (especially) nation state governments. Another is that registering a domain name costs money. The money you pay for a domain name is not so much a contribution to
  the cost of running the world's DNS infrastructure, but more a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">proof-of-work</a> threshold which curbs domain name squatting to some extent. If registering a domain name
  were cheaper, then it would be even harder to find a domain name that is not yet taken.</p>

<h3>Portals and search engines</h3>
<p>Domain names are sufficient for keeping track of the SMTP, FTP, SSH and other accounts you connect to, but to look up general information on the web, you often
  need to connect to servers whose domain name you don't know by heart, or might not even have heard of before starting a given lookup.
  Using just DNS to locate resources on the web was just not going to work. You will only be able to find information you have seen before.
  So it soon became clear
  that DNS was not enough for a satisfactory web surf experience, and portals were invented, effectively as an augmentation of DNS.</p>
<p>A portal effectively replaces the DNS system, because instead of remembering that the information you were looking for is hosted on
  "http://http://www.myfriendtheplatypus.com/", you would have "http://dir.yahoo.com/" as your home page, and remember that you could get to it by clicking
  Science -> Biology -> Zoology -> Animals, Insects, and Pets -> Mammals -> Monotremes -> Platypus.</p>
<p>The big advantage of this was of course that you only have to remember these string receptively, not productively: you are presented with multiple-choice
  questions, not one open question. And apart from that, it is interactive: you take multiple smaller steps and can reach your target step-by-step.</p>
<p>A big disadvantage is of course that it takes one or two minutes to traverse Yahoo's directory until you get to the page that contains the information you need.
  Also, you have to know that a platypus is a monotreme. In this case, while writing out this example, I actually used a search engine to look that up. ;)</p>
<p>Then, search engines became better, and over the decades we arrived at a web where "being on the web" means you have not only done your
  Domain Name Registration (DNR), but also your Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The similarity between domain names and search terms is emphasized by the fact
  that several browsers now provide one input field as a combined address bar and search widget.</p>
