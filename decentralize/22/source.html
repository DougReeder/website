<!-- search: How to locate resources -->
<p>Last week, Adrian reminded me that there should be an episode about search. So, here goes! :)</p>

<h3>URLs, DNS, and DNR</h3>
<p>The DNS system is a distributed (but centralized) database that maps easy-to-remember domain names onto hard-to-remember IP addresses. In the process, it provides
a level of indirection whereby the IP address of a given service may change while domain name stays the same.</p>
<p>These two characteristics make DNS+HTTPS the perfect basis for weaving together hypertext documents. One downside of DNS is that it is subject to attacks from
  (especially) nation state governments. Another is that registering a domain name costs money. The money you pay for a domain name is not so much a contribution to
  the cost of running the world's DNS infrastructure, but more a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">proof-of-work</a> threshold which curbs domain name squatting to some extent. If registering a domain name
  were cheaper, then it would be even harder to find a domain name that is not yet taken.</p>

<h3>Portals and search engines</h3>
<p>Domain names are sufficient for keeping track of the SMTP, FTP, SSH and other accounts you connect to, but to look up general information on the web, you often
  need to connect to servers whose domain name you don't know by heart, or might not even have heard of before starting a given lookup.
  Using just DNS to locate resources on the web was just not going to work. You will only be able to find information you have seen before.
  So it soon became clear
  that DNS was not enough for a satisfactory web surf experience, and portals were invented, effectively as an augmentation of DNS.</p>
<p>A portal effectively replaces the DNS system, because instead of remembering that the information you were looking for is hosted on
  "http://http://www.myfriendtheplatypus.com/", you would have "http://dir.yahoo.com/" as your home page, and remember that you could get to it by clicking
  Science -> Biology -> Zoology -> Animals, Insects, and Pets -> Mammals -> Monotremes -> Platypus.</p>
<p>The big advantage of this was of course that you only have to remember these string receptively, not productively: you are presented with multiple-choice
  questions, not one open question. And apart from that, it is interactive: you take multiple smaller steps and can reach your target step-by-step.</p>
<p>A big disadvantage is of course that it takes one or two minutes to traverse Yahoo's directory until you get to the page that contains the information you need.
  Also, you have to know that a platypus is a monotreme. In this case, while writing out this example, I actually used a search engine to look that up. ;)</p>
<p>Then, search engines became better, and over the decades we arrived at a web where "being on the web" means you have not only done your
  Domain Name Registration (DNR), but also your Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The similarity between domain names and search terms is emphasized by the fact
  that several browsers now provide one input field as a combined address bar and search widget.</p>

<h3>Bookmarks and shared links</h3>
<p>For general information, portals and search engines make most sense, but the web is also often used for communication that is "socially local": viewing photos
  that your friends uploaded, for instance. Or essays on specific advanced topics which are propagated within tiny specialist expert communities.</p>
<p>For this, links are often shared through channels that are socially local to the recipient and the publisher of the link, and maybe even the publisher of the resource.</p>
<p>This can be email messages, mailing lists, people who follow each other on Twitter, or who are friends on Facebook, etcetera. You can even propagate links to web resources
  via voice-over-air (in real life, that is).</p>
<p>It is also quite common for (power) users of the web to keep bookmarks as a sort of addressbook of content which you may want to find back in the future.</p>
<p>All these "out of band" methods of propagating links to web resources constitute decentralized alternatives to the portals and search engines as augmentations of DNS.</p>

<h3>Link quality, search bubbles, collaborative indexes and web-of-trust</h3>
<p>Portals used to be edited largely by humans who somehow guarded the quality threshold for a web page to make it into the directory. Search engines are often filled on the
  basis of mechanical crawling, where algorithms like
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> extract quality information out of the web's hyperlink graph. With
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch">GraphSearch</a>, Facebook proposes to offer a search engine which is biased towards the searcher's reported interests
  and those of their friends.</p>
<p>In the case of bookmarks and shared links, the quality of links is also guarded by the human choice to retweet something or to forward a certain email. In a way, this
principle allows the blogosphere to partially replace some of the roles of journalism. It is also interesting how this blurs the barrier between objective knowledge and
socially local opinions or viewpoints.</p>
<p>If you use Google in Spanish, from Spain, while being logged in with your Google account, you will not see all the same information an anonymous searcher may find
  when searching from a different country and in a different language. This effect has been called
  the <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-bubble-response-13591.html">Filter Bubble</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you see the filter bubble as an enhancement of your search experience or as a form of censorship may depend on your personal preference, but in any case it is
  good to be aware of it, so you can judge the search results you get from a search engine a bit more accurately. In a real life situation you would also always take into
  account the source of the information you consume, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a> generally gain value by travelling (or failing to travel)
through the web of trust, and in collaborative indexes.</p>
<p>Socially local effects on search results are often implemented in centralized ways. For instance, Amazon was one of the first websites to pioneer the "people who bought
  this product also bought this other one" suggestions.</p>

<h3>Don't track us</h3>
<p>Offering good suggestions to users from a centralized database requires building up this database first, by tracking people. There are several ways to do this; in order
  to protect people's privacy, it is important to anonymize the logs from their activity before adding it to the behavioral database. It is also questionable if such
  information should be allowed to be federated between unrelated services, since this leads to the build-up of very strong concentrations of power.</p>
<p>Whereas Amazon's suggestion service mainly indexes products which Amazon sells to its users itself, Google and Facebook additionally track what their users do on unrelated
  websites. When a website includes Google Ads or Google Statistics, information about that website's users is leaked to Google. And if a website displays a 'Like' button,
  it leaks information about its visitors to Facebook.</p>
<p>This tracking information is then not only used to improve the search results, but also to improve the targetting of the advertising that appears on websites. If you read
  <a href="http://thegooglestory.com/">The Google Story</a>, it becomes clear how incredibly lucrative it is to spy on your users. In my opinion it is not inherently evil 
  for a service to spy on its users, as long as the user has the option to choose an alternative that doesn't. A restaurant that serves meat is not forcing anyone to eat
  meat.</p>
<p>The free technology movement is currently not really able to offer viable alternatives to Google and to Facebook. A lot of projects that try come and go, or don't hit
  the mark, and it sometimes feels like an uphill struggle. But I'm confident that we'll get on top of
  this again, just like the free-tech alternatives to all parts of the Microsoft stack have eventually matured. Firefox default, DDG, Yaci, Seeks</p>
