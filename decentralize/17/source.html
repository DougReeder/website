<h3>Why we dropped cryptography from our charter</h3>
<p><strong>We are always looking for more talented javascript developers.</strong> If you develop an unhosted web app, then you can add it to the
<a href="https://unhosted.org/apps/">examples page</a>; most of the apps mentioned on there have issue trackers on github, so you can submit bug reports there if you
have any problems using any of the apps, and if you have any questions or remarks in general, then just send them to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unhosted">forum</a>. Comments very welcome!</p>
