<p>Unhosted web apps have no own server-side part, by definition. The same is true for native mobile apps: although a lot of native mobile apps communicate with a server-side API of the same vendor, the native app itself is only what is downloaded from the app store onto the user's device.</p>
<p>In both cases, it can make sense for an application provider to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend_as_a_service">Backend-as-a-Service</a> system; BaaS, for short.</p>
<h3>Single-provider BaaS systems</h3>
<p>A lot of BaaS providers offer a backend system of which they host the only instance. This means that there is only one (usually commercial) party providing that system, and if at any point you're unhappy with them, you have nowhere to migrate to without switching to an different system with a different API.

<p>They typically offer things like data storage, real-time sync, push notification, media streaming, geo location, user management, analytics,
 etcetera. Kinley created a <a href="http://www.kinvey.com/blog/121/the-backend-as-a-service-ecosystem-map-update-amp-new-trends-migration-toward-the-middle">map of the BaaS ecosystem</a> which lists all these many BaaS startups, including pacman symbols to show who is being acquired who.</p>

Next week we'll look at per-user backend, including proprietary per-user solutions like
Google's GoogleDrive
Microsoft's OneDrive
Apple's iCloud
Dropbox Dropbox Platform
Facebook Platform
: platform APIs for single-instance systems that have their own users
Stay tuned!
