<p>Unhosted web apps have no own server-side part, by definition. The same is true for native mobile apps: although a lot of native mobile apps communicate with a server-side API of the same vendor, the native app itself is only what is downloaded from the app store onto the user's device.</p>
<p>In both cases, it can make sense for an application provider to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend_as_a_service">Backend-as-a-Service</a> system; BaaS, for short.</p>
<h3>Single-provider BaaS systems</h3>
<p>A lot of BaaS providers offer a backend system of which they host the only instance. This means that there is only one (usually commercial) party providing that system, and if at any point you're unhappy with them, you have nowhere to migrate to without switching to an different system with a different API.
