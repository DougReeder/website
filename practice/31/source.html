<h3>Users who own their backend</h3>
<p>The architecture of the web originally focused on allowing independent publishers to have their own web site on which they publish public ontent. In the web 2.0 architecture, bigger web sites started hosting user content - public as well as limited-audience and private. In the meantime, desktop and mobile operating systems did allow users to own their data storage - at least the local data storage on a hard disk or memory card.</p>

<p>What we're trying to do with unhosted web apps and per-user backends, is to change the web to a software platform on which owning your data is possible. Unhosted web apps by themselves allow you to use the local on-device data storage, but to add device-to-device sync and cloud backup, it is necessary for the user to own some place where this data can be stored: a per-user backend.</p>

<h3>Per-user storage</h3>
<p>The first and most important requirement for per-user backend is storage. There are a number of providers of proprietary per-user cloud storage:
Google's <a href="https://drive.google.com/">GoogleDrive</a>,
Microsoft's <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/">OneDrive</a>,
Apple's <a href=""https://www.icloud.com/>iCloud</a>,
Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore">Dropbox Platform</a>. Of these, Google and Microsoft offer cloud storage as an addition to their offering of cloud services; Microsoft and Apple offer cloud storage sign up from the operating systems that are pre-installed on Windows and iOS/OSX devices respectively, and Dropbox is the only one in this list who just offers proprietary per-user cloud storage as their main product.</p>
<p>Other smaller-scale providers of per-user cloud storage include <a href="https://www.box.com/">box.com</a>, <a href="https://www.powerfolder.com/">powerfolder</a>, <a href="http://www.sparkleshare.org/">SparkeShare</a>, <a href="http://www.mesh.com/">LiveMesh</a>, <a href="http://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a>, several <a href="https://owncloud.org/providers/">ownCloud providers</a>, and for instance the startup behind tahoe-lafs, <a href="https://leastauthority.com/product_s4/">LeastAuthority</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/">megaSYNC</a> resells storage space from their own network of independent hosters, <a href="https://www.wuala.com/">Wuala</a> invites users to share some of their own storage space, and <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">BitTorrent</a> uses only storage space at connected clients.</p>
<p>In the context of unhosted web apps like <a href="https://export.5apps.com/">export.5apps.com</a>, we are mainly interested in the ones that offer a cross-origin API. That limits the choice to Google, Dropbox, and all providers of 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dejong-remotestorage-03">remoteStorage</a> (currently only <a href="https://5apps.com/storage/beta">5apps</a>).

<h3>Per-user backend protocols</h3>
<p>The only non-proprietary protocol we are aware of that allows unhosted web apps to communicate with per-user backends, is our own remoteStorage protocol. It could make sense to define more such protocols, for other functionalities than just storage, but in practice most projects publish one specific software application which users can run on their own server, and retrospectively declare the API of that software application to be an open protocol which other software applications may choose to mimick. Also, the UX flow of the end-point discovery is often left undefined. Examples are
Firefox Sync (at the browser level, Firefox only),
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> (if you enable CORS headers on it),
and <a href="http://sockethub.org/">Sockethub</a>.
Often, the user would have to paste the exact URL of their server's API into a text field somewhere in the settings of an application, to connect one of these per-user backends.</p>
<p>For Hoodie, use as a per-user backend has always been part of the plan, and there is an <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server/pull/288">open pull request</a> for this, but it's not currently supported yet.</p>


<h3>Per-user backend other than storage</h3>
Not as important
Firefox Loop
Sockethub? Hoodie?
proprietary:
Facebook's <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments">Facebook Platform</a>:

<p>Next week we look at client-side libraries.</p>
