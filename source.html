<p style="margin-top:3em; border-radius:1em; box-shadow:0 0 1em #D0D0D0; padding: 1em">Also known as "serverless", "client-side", 
or "static" web apps, unhosted web apps do not send 
your user data to their server.
You connect your own server, 
or your data stays within the browser.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">advantages compared to native apps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>they work on any device, any manufacturer, any platform, any provider</li>
  <li>anybody can run an app store for them
(<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-apps/AZcMm413xww/discussion">except</a> Chrome packaged apps)</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">unhosted web apps compared to hosted web apps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>choice of server provider is not determined by your choice of app provider</li>
  <li>the app provider no longer gets to see your data by default</li>
  <li>they are cheaper to publish</li>
  <li>they can easily be mirrored for resilience</li>
  <li>infinite per-app backend scalability (there simply is no per-app backend)</li>
</ul>
