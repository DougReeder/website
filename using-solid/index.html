      CHANGELOG from 0.8 to 0.9:
      * globbing, sparql-on-get, and acl:trustedApp are gone.
      * servers are allowed to be eventually consistent, although this is not recommended.
      * WebSockets-pubsub clients SHOULD now send AUTH, but servers should not require it yet.
      * Apps SHOULD support both webid-oidc flows, but IDPs and storage providers SHOULD
      still support the old one.

      <h2>Solid explained</h2>

      <p>Solid is similar to remoteStorage in that it allows apps (including unhosted web apps)
      to store the user's data under the user's control. Where it differs from remoteStorage
      is in its focus on linked data and its ACL system.</p>
      <p>This article describes how you can use Solid to develop an app that allows the user to
      connect their Solid pod as the per-user data storage. In January 2020 the 'roughly 0.9'
      version was tagged, so Solid server implementers should now aim to support that. Solid
      app developers should still rely on the previous version ('roughly 0.8', which was tagged
      in May 2019. This web page describes Solid 0.9, but indicates at each step if 0.8 differs.</p>

      <h3>WebId-OIDC</h3>
      <p>A WebId is a URL that uniquely identifies a user. Using WebId-OIDC, the app can obtain an
        id token which proves that the user currently interacting with the app controls that WebId.
        From this id token, a bearer token can be derived. The exact way in which this happens is
        described in <a href="https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec">the WebID-OIDC spec</a>.
        As an app developer you can
        <a href="https://solidproject.org/for-developers/apps/first-app/1-authentication">rely</a> on
          <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-auth-client">Solid Auth Client</a> to obtain the id token
        for the currently interacting user, and to produce the bearer token.
      </p>

      <h3>Web of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>The starting point for the web of data around the currently interacting user is their
        profile document, which is always hosted at the user's WebID, and is always publically readable.
        From there, you can discover links to the user's inbox, public and private type index, and other data.</p>
        <p>The inbox is a folder to which anybody can POST, but only the user themselves can read. It is useful
          for sending the user a message. Some domain-specific inboxes also exist in Solid, for instance for
          playing Tic-Tac-Toe and for friend requests, messages can be sent either to the user's global inbox, or
          to the domain-specific one if it exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The public and private type indexes list links to public and private documents that describe an instance
          of a specific RDF type. For instance, the public type index might link to a user's public list of bookmarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A full overview of data that you might find on a user's pod, and how to discover it, is in the client-client spec
          which is currently under construction, but a good draft so far can be found in the
          <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-panes/blob/master/Documentation/conventions.md">data conventions</a> of the
          Solid databrowser.
        </p>
      <h3>Read-Write Web</h3>
      <p>Reading and writing data is pretty similar to what you would expect if you know a bit about HTTP and you know how
        it works for remoteStorage. To read, the usual HEAD and GET verbs can be used. Data is stored hierarchically with files
        in folders, which are formally defined as LDP Resources and LDP BasicContainers. There are 4 types of resources: containers
        (their URL ends in a forward slash), non-RDF resources, ACL documents, and other RDF sources. Container, ACL documents, and
        other RDF sources are all RDF sources, non-RDF resources are not. The container representation is the one
        from the LDP BasicContainer, so direct children are listed with (subject, predicate, object) triples, where the subject
        is the container URL, and the predicate
        is <tt>ldp:contains</tt>.</p>
        <p>All operations on ACL documents act the same way as on other RDF resources, except that they always require Control access
          over the resource to which the ACL applies, regardless of whether it's a reading, creating, appending, modifying, or deleting
          operation. There is now way to know if a resource is an ACL document, except that the resource to which it applies will link
          back to it with a Link response header (relation: 'acl').
        </p>
        <p></p>HEAD and GET on non-ACL documents both require Read access. The difference between other RDF sources and non-RDF resources
        is that GET on RDF sources supports content negotiation to convert
        from JSON-LD to Turtle or vice-versa.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to create a new resouce: POST and PUT. POST adds a new resource inside a container, and although you
          can specify a <tt>Slug</tt> header to influence the resulting location, the server decides the URL at which the resource
          will be created. For PUT, the client can choose the location. In both cases, the server will create any ancestor containers on the 
          path from the domain root to the URL of the request if they don't exist yet. If a container needs to be created then it
          requires Write access on that container and Append or Write access on its parent. A POST request requires Append or Write access on the container 
          the resource is being created in. A PUT does too, but additionally it requires Write access to the URL of the newly created resouce
          itself. It's not possible to create an empty container, other than by creating a dummy resource inside it (and then deleting that again).
          </p>
          <p>
            A DELETE of a resource requires Write access to the resource and Read+Write to the container it's in. A container can only be
            deleted if it's empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            A resource that contains valid JSON-LD or Turtle is known as an LDP-RS, and is officially a representation-independent RDF data
            source; it is converted to either JSON-LD or Turtle only when you retrieve it. This means that a Solid serve may lose formatting
            details and comments, even when you store a Turtle file and then retrieve it again as Turtle.</p>
            <p>Such a Turtle or JSON-LD document can be edited using a PATCH request with a (restricted) sparql-update body.
              The sparql-update body can include INSERT and DELETE instructions. If one of the DELETE instructions fails, the request fails as
              a whole and is not executed. PATCH requests that contain only INSERTs require either Append or Write. PATCH requests that
              also contain DELETEs require Write + Read. Like for POST and PUT, PATCH will cause all ancestor containers to be created if they
            are missing, and the whole operation will fail if permissions are insufficient.</p>
      <h3>ACL documents</h3>
      <p>An ACL document on a non-container affects only that resource. An ACL document on a container affects that container plus all its
        descendants as long as they don't have their own ACL document. So if there is an ACL document for / and for /a/b, then the ACL document
        for / affects all resources that start with /, except /a/b.</p>
    <p>If no Authorizations exist, then access is denied ("deny then allow" approach). Authorization can only appear in the ACL document
      that apply. No other ACL documents are relevant (not even ones on parent or ancestor containers).
      An ACL doc is a list of Authorizations.
      An Authorization applies if it has RDF type `acl:Authorization`, and the WebID is allowed, and the origin is allowed.
      The modes that are allowed are the union over all Authorizations that apply.
      If a request has no Origin header, or if public access is allowed, then the origin is allowed.
      The origin is also allowed if it is linked from the authorization with an `acl:origin` triple.
      The WebId can be allowed in four ways:
      - if `acl:AgentClass foaf:Agent` is linked from the authorization (regardless of whether a bearer token was even supplied at all)
      - if `acl:agentClass solid:agent` is linked, and the request specifies some WebId through a WebID-OIDC bearer token
      - if `acl:agentGroup` points to a `vcard:Group` which lists the WebID
      - if the WebID is directly linked through an `acl:agent` triple.
    </p>
      <h3>Updates</h3>
      <p>On each resource, you'll find an `Updates-Via` response header, pointing to a WebSocket server. Connect, and send
        `auth [bearer_token]`, then `sub [url]`. You'll get `ack [url]` back, and then `pub [url]` each time the resource changes.
        A change can be a creation, update, or deletion. If you subscribe to a container, you'll only see creation and deletion of the container
        itself, and changes to its list of `ldp:contains`
        triples, not any changes to the resources it contains.
      </p>
