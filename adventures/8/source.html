<p>As a member of the No Cookie Crew you will using unhosted web apps for everything you currently use hosted web apps for.
None of these apps will store your user data, because they do not have a server backend to store it on. You will have to
store your data yourself.</p>
<p>Collecting and organizing your own data is quite a bit of work, depending on how organized you want to be about it.
This work is usually done by the developers and system administrators of the hosted web apps you have been using.
The main task is to "tidy your room", like a kid putting all their toys back in the right storage place inside their bedroom.</p>

<h3>Collecting your data from your own backups</h3>
<p>We sometimes like to pretend that the Chromebook generation is already here, and that all our data is in the cloud. In reality,
obviously, a lot of our data is still just on our laptop hard disk, on external hard disks, on USB sticks, and on DVDs that we
created over the years.</p>
<p>The first step towards making this data usable with unhosted web apps is to put it all together in one place. When I started
doing this, I realised I have roughly four types of data, if you split by the reason why I'm keeping it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Souvenirs: mainly folders with photos, and videos. I hardly ever access these, but at the same time they are in a way
    the most valuable, since they are unique and personal, and represent powerful memories.</li>
  <li>Products: things I published in the past, like for instance papers I wrote as a student, code I published over the years,
    and the content of my website. In several cases I have source files that were not published as such, for instance original
    svg files of designs that were published only as png files, or screen-printed onto a T-shirt. It's all the original raw copies
    of the things that took me some effort to create, and that I may want to reuse in the future.</li>
  <li>Media Cache: my music collection, mostly. It used to be that when you lost a CD, you could no longer listen to it, but for
    all but the most obscure and rare albums, this is no longer the case, and should you lose this data, then it's easy to get
    it back from elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Working Set: the files I open and edit most often, but that are part of a product that is not finished yet, or that
    (unlike souvenirs) have only a temporary relevance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most work goes into pruning the ever growing Working Set: determining which files and folders can be safely deleted (or moved
to the "old/" folder), archiving all the source files of products I've published, and deciding which souvenirs to keep and which
ones are really just more of the same.</p>
<p>My "to do" list and calendar clearly fit into "Working Set", but the one thing that doesn't really fit into this is my address
book. It is at the same time part of my working set, my products, and my souvenirs. I use them it on a daily basis, but many contacts
in there are from the past, and I only keep them just in case some day I want to reuse those contacts for a new project, and of course
there is also a nostalgic value to an address book.</p>

<h3>Some stuff on your Indie Web server, the rest on your Freedombox server</h3>
<p>At first, we had the idea of putting all this data of various types into one remotestorage account. This idea quickly ran into three
problems: first, after scanning in all my backup DVDs, even after removing all the duplicate folders, I had gathered about 40 Gigs, and my
server only has 7 Gigs of disk space. It is possible to get a bigger server of course, but this didn't seem like an efficient thing to
spend money on, especially for the Media Cache data.</p>
<p>Second, I am often in places with limited bandwidth, and even if I would upload 40 Gigs to my remote server, it would still be a waste
of resources to try to stream music from there for hours on end.</p>
<p>Third, even though I want to upload my photos to a place where I can share them with friends, I have a lot of my photos in formats
that take up several Megabytes, and typically photos you share online would probably be more around 50 K for good online browsing
performance. So even if I upload all my photos to my Indie Web server, I would want to upload the "web size" version of them, and not
the huge originals.</p>
<p>After some discussion with Basti and Fran&cdille;ois, I concluded that having one remote storage server is not enough to cover all use
cases: you need two. The "Indie Web" one should be always on, on a public domain name, and the "Freedombox" one should be in your home.</p>
<p>On your Indie Web server, you would store only a copy of your Working Set data,
plus probably sized down derivatives of some of your products and
souvenirs. On your Freedombox you would simply store everything.</p>
<p>This means you will already have to do some manual versioning, probably, and think about when to upload something to your Indie Web
server.
Export your data from Google: <img src="google.png" />

and from Facebook: <img src="facebook.png" />

for twitter, data is mostly transient, but to export your contacts,
you can do for instance this:
on https://twitter.com/following or https://twitter.com/followers
open the web console (Ctrl-Shift-K in Firefox), and paste:
<pre><code>
  var screenNames = [],
    accounts = document.getElementsByClassName('account');
  for(var i=0; i<accounts.length; i++) {
    screenNames.push(accounts[i].getAttribute('data-screen-name'));
  }
  alert(screenNames);
</code></pre>
Do make sure you scroll down first to get all the accounts in view.
You could also go through the api of course (see episode 5).
  
  
      <h2>Episode 10: Collecting and organizing your data</h2>



You will have souvenirs, products, "media cache" and "hand data". Media cache is data of which
you keep a mirror copy, even if it's available online, because it's big, or because you are not
always online. Hand data refers to currently unfinished projects, but also
includes pan-project data like your contacts or calendar:
    souvenirs
    products
    mediaCache
    handData
      contacts
      messages+stream
      calendar+tasks
      money
      bookmarks
      preferences+settings
      documents

Convert photos to 50K "web size"

Convert your music and sound to ogg:

    for i in `ls */*/*` ; do echo avconv -i $i -acodec libvorbis -aq 60 ~/allmydata/mediaCache/$i.ogg ; done | sh

Convert your videos to ogg: [TODO: fix image quality, make sound work]

    for i in `ls *.AVI` ; do echo avconv -i $i -f ogg ~/allmydata/souvenirs/$i.ogg ; done | sh
