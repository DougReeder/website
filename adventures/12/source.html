<!-- app discovery: App discovery -->
<h3>App discovery (was: App distribution).</h3>
<p>So you developed an unhosted web app, and it's ready for your potential future customers 
  to get your app onto all their nice and shiny mobile, portable, and transportable devices.
  So to make that happen, you should "distribute" your app through an app store, or some other
  kind of app distribution channel, right? No. Wrong.</p>
<p>This is the web, it gets
  it power from being slightly different from conventional software platforms. In the last two
  episodes we talked about web linking and app hosting. And if you combine them, then you already
  have all you need. But with a huge advantage: the web is open.</p>
<p>The web is open-ended, in that it has no boundary that defines where it stops. It can go on and
  on into virtual infinity.</p>
<p>But it also has an "open beginning", so to speak. The web is a graph where most other systems are trees, as
  Melvin likes to say.</p>
<p>So what is needed for your potential future users to be able to launch your app? Exactly those two 
  things: web linking and app hosting. They will need a hyperlink to the URL on which your app is hosted,
  that's all. It's not a coincidence that I brought these topics up in this order. :)</p>
<p>So in this episode we will not talk about how to distribute your product. We will talk about how to make
  it discoverable, assuming that you are hosting it somewhere.</p>

<h3>Hyperlink style guides (was: Manifest files).</h3>
<p>A web app manifest is a small file that you need for "putting a web app onto your device".
  Right? No. Wrong again. It's a guide for <em>styling</em> something that is essentially just a good old hyperlink.</p>
<p>In hypertext, a link is presented to the user as a (usually underlined) anchor text. The anchor text is
  supposed to describe, in the context of the current document, what you will see when you click on the link.</p>
<p>For linking to apps, we would like to do a bit more. Often, the link will be presented in a loose context
  (for instance, an unstructured list like on our <a href="https://unhosted.org/apps/">examples page</a>), and as
  the app publisher you will have some ideas on how you want your product to appear in such listings. That is why
  app publishers often provide a sort of "hyperlink style guide", which describes "if you are going to publish a
  link to my app, then please do it in this and this way".</p>
<p>There are several formats for publishing such a hyperlink style guide; they are called manifest files in web app lingo.
  The two prime examples are the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/manifests">Open Web App</a> format
  proposed by Mozilla, and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide#live">hosted Chrome app</a>
  format proposed by Google.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, these style guide formats are very simple: they basically define a few icons in various sizes,
  the preferred name to display, in the right spelling and capitalization, and some other additional fields, like maybe a
  short description of the app and of its author. And of course the URL of the app itself, which is what the hyperlink should link to.</p>
<p>Both these manifest file formats also let you predict which elevated privileges (like geolocation or webcam access) your app will
  request once the user click on the
  hyperlink, but this is a silly thing to put into a hyperlink style guide, for reasons we'll discuss below. So let's ignore that part for now.</p>
<p>You might be a bit surprised that there are various alternative proposals for this "hyperlink style guide" format that we call manifest
  files: why can't we just agree on one common format for this?
  I was also surprised by this splintering, but once you realise how simple and basic these files are, it becomes obvious that it's trivial
  to just provide your style guide
  in both formats, and that in practice this is simply just a very small problem that hasn't made itself very urgent to resolve yet.
  It's probably even possible to create one JSON document that will work as both formats, just make sure you make your <code>launch_path</code>
  field matches with the URL path of your <code>app.launch.web_url</code> field. The topic of these many formats was also briefly discussed
  in the "Elevated Privileges" panel at EdgeConf (see minute 20:40 and further):</p>
  <script>
  function showVideo(that) {
    that.innerHTML = '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ytJKdipILiU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>';
  }
</script><h4 style="text-align: center" onclick="showVideo(this);">(show http://www.youtube.com/embed/ytJKdipILiU)</h4>
<p>Also, when you host your apps on 5apps, you will have a tool there for generating manifest files in all the (rapidly changing) formats.</p>

<h3>Review sites (was: App stores).</h3>
<p>What, so that's it? What about the whole thing with the app stores? How can people use my app if I don't put it into all the major app stores?</p>
<p>If you look at what app stores are and what they do, they are actually nothing more than review sites. Or maybe something in between a review
  site, a directory, a portal, and a search engine.</p>
<p>People go to an app store to find links to apps. Often, there will be a certain chain of trust at play there: the user trusts a certain review site
  (app store), and the review site has reviewed a certain app and not found any obvious malware in it, so the user can be a bit more certain that the
  app they launch is relatively trustworthy.</p>
<p>On our Indie Web sites, we can also all present lists of apps that we recommend. It will give our friends some more information about which apps might
  be worth trying out - a bit like a Retweet or a Like. All you need is a hyperlink.</p>
<p>Given that we have these hyperlink style guides we talked about earlier, let's try to create a bit of javascript that generates nice styleguide-compliant
  html on the fly. Here is one for Open Web App manifest files:</p>
<code><pre><!DOCTYPE html>
  <body>
    <div class="openwebapp">{
      icons: {
        128: "editor.png"
      }
    }</div>
  </body>
  <script src="//unhosted.org/adventures/12/launchbutton.js"></script>
</pre></code>
<p>If you include this into your website (you might want to copy the .js file and host it yourself), it will look something like this on your site:</p>

<div><img src="editor.png" /></div>
<h1>todo: write inline manifest interpreter</h1>

<p>As you can see, there is nothing stopping you from being an app store yourself! :) If you do this, then you should consider one thing: the value of
  a portal site is in the things that are not on it. The Apple platform is so popular <em>because</em> it is closed. The fact that "fart apps" are banned
  from the iOS App Store is what sets the quality level. Building a strict and prestigious portal site is not evil, it is a good thing. What is regrettable
  about the Apple platform is that it locks in hardware choice with software choice, and that it takes an extortionate profit margin, made possible
  by this monopoly situation.</p>
<p>But in itself, rejecting apps from your recommendation list, if it is done with the user's interests in mind, can lead to a sort of Michelin guide to
  unhosted web apps. You just have to look at the value of Debian ("if it's in Debian, then you can be sure it's stable"), to see a precedent of this in the
  free software world.</p>

<h3>System apps (was: packaged web apps).</h3>
<p>Last summer, Google decided to hardcode their Chrome Web Store into their Chrome Browser as the only allowed source of packaged web apps.</p>
<p>A packaged web app is a zip file containing the static files that make up an unhosted web app. It is essentially the same as  browser extension, add-on,
  or plugin in many ways. At first I was quite
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-apps/AZcMm413xww/discussion">upset about this</a>,
  but after thinking a lot more about app discovery, and watching the
  "elevated privileges" panel from EdgeConf recently, in my head I have assigned a different interpretation to this move.</p>
<p>Chrome packaged apps should be regarded as "System apps". Through the elevated priviliges they can get at install-time, they form a part of the actual Chrome
  operating system, not of the content you visit with it.</p>

TODO: fit this in somewhere:
<p>Both manifest formats we saw earlier also provide ways to describe some elevated permissions the app would like to request upfront, if opened from a hyperlink
  styled according to that manifest. If you put it that way, then this system suddenly sounds very weird. :)</p>

<p>Firefox OS has a similar concept of System Apps, like the Dialer, and the Configuration Dialogs (TODO: look this up). They have to be distributed through the
  same channel as the operating system itself, since they are on the "system" side of the operating system's application sandbox barrier.
  Otherwise you can't design a stable device operating system.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that they use the same technology, system apps are an entirely different game from the unhosted web apps that you run as applications. It makes
  sense for system apps to be packaged rather than hosted, because you ship them as pluggable parts of a device operating system, and not as generic
  unhosted "userland" software.</p>
<p>For all applications other than system apps, it makes sense to use (statics-only) app hosting rather than packaging, since that way their components are not locked in,
  and users can use all the standard web tricks to, for instance, view their source code, or refer to the app, or to some of the content inside the app, with a
  normal hyperlink as we've always done.</p>

<h3>Apptorrent, mirroring, and unhosting Wikipedia.</h3>
<p>There is a fascinating aspect in the concept of packaged web apps though: they are robust against attacks on our DNS system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, governments block websites.
  Probably in almost all cases this is done by people who think they are doing the right thing: they really honestly think that Facebook is bad for Vietnam, or that
  Wikileaks is bad for the USA, or that ThePirateBay is bad for the Netherlands, and that such censorship is eventually in the interest of the people who installed them as
  government employees.</p>
<p>Or maybe they honestly think the interests of Communism, or the interest of National Security, or the interest of Entertainment Industry are more
  important than considerations about freedom of communication.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons of such actions, and whatever the moral judgement on whether Facebook, Wikileaks and ThePirateBay are evil websites, from a technological design
  principle of "kill-switch resilience", it would be nice if we had a way to publish unhosted web apps in a decentralized way.</p>
<p>It would also just be nice from a practical point of view to have a local copy of a lot of information which we often look up online. I am writing this right now in a place
  without wifi, and so far I have made five notes of things I should look up on <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> later. If I had a local copy of MDN, that would
  make me a lot less reliant on connectivity.</p>
<p>As an example, let's take Wikipedia. A very big chunk of all human knowledge is on there. You can download a compressed xml file containing all the text (not the images)
  of the English edition. It's about 9 Gigabytes. Massaging this a bit, and adding the necessary rendering code, we could make this into an unhosted web app that can be run
  on localhost, using a simple statics hosting script like the ones we've seen in previous episodes.</p>
<p>The obvious way to distribute such a multi-Gigabyte file would be bittorrent. So that sounds totally feasible: we put huge unhosted web apps into torrent files, and
  everybody can cooperate in seeding them. We could do this for Wikipedia, MDN, Kahn Academy, Open Yale Courses, this year's EdgeConf panel discussions, anything you like.
  Given how cheap a 1 Terabyte external hard drive is nowadays (about 80 USD), you could even unhost the entire Gutenberg project, and still have some disk space left.</p>
<p>And of course, you could use this for small apps as well. Even if unhosted web apps cache themselves in your browser when you use them, it would be nice to have an
  app server somewhere inside your LAN that just hosts thousands of unhosted web apps on local URLs, so that you can access them quickly without relying on connectivity.</p>
<p>This is an idea that I started thinking about a couple of weeks ago, and I don't have any example code for it yet, but I will update this blogpost as soon as I do.</p>
<p>In any case, try out the "launchbutton.js" file I showed above, and link to some apps from your website. App hosting and web linking should be all you need here.
  The web doesn't need a new "app distribution layer" like Apple's iOS App Store. The web <em>already is</em> one big, infinite app store.</p>
