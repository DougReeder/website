<!-- app discovery: App discovery -->
<h3>App discovery (was: App distribution).</h3>
<p>So you developed an unhosted web app, and it's ready for your potential future customers 
  to get your app onto all their nice and shiny mobile, portable, and transportable devices.
  So to make that happen, you should "distribute" your app through an app store, or some other
  kind of app distribution channel, right? No. Wrong.</p>
<p>This is the web, it gets
  it power from being slightly different from conventional software platforms. In the last two
  episodes we talked about web linking and app hosting. And if you combine them, then you already
  have all you need. But with a huge advantage: the web is open.</p>
<p>The web is open-ended, in that it has no boundary that defines where it stops. It can go on and
  on into virtual infinity.</p>
<p>But it is also "open-beginninged", if there is such a thing. The web is a graph where most other systems are trees, as
  Melvin likes to say.</p>
<p>So what is needed for your potential future users to be able to launch your app? Exactly those two 
  things: web linking and app hosting. They will need a hyperlink to the URL on which your app is hosted,
  that's all. It's not a coincidence that I brought these topics up in this order. :)</p>
<p>So in this episode we will not talk about how to distribute your product. We will talk about how to make
  it discoverable, assuming that you are hosting it somewhere.</p>

<h3>Hyperlink style guides (was: Manifest files).</h3>
<p>In hypertext, a link is presented to the user as a (usually underlined) anchor text. The anchor text is
  supposed to describe, in the context of the current document, what you will see when you click on the link.</p>
<p>For linking to apps, we would like to do a bit more. Often, the link will be presented in a loose context
  (for instance, an unstructured list like on our <a href="https://unhosted.org/apps/">examples page</a>), and as
  the app publisher you will have some ideas on how you want your product to appear in such listings. That is why
  app publishers often provide a sort of "hyperlink style guide", which describes "if you are going to publish a
  link to my app, then please do it in this and this way".</p>
<p>There are several formats for publishing such a hyperlink style guide; they are called manifest files in web app lingo.
  The two prime examples are the <a href="...">Open Web App</a> format proposed by Mozilla, and the <a href="...">hosted Chrome app</a>
  format proposed by Google.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, these style guide formats are very simple: they basically define a few icons in various sizes,
  the preferred name to display, in the right spelling and capitalization, and some other additional fields, like maybe a
  short description of the app and of its author. And of course the URL of the app itself, which is what the hyperlink should link to.</p>
<p>You might be a bit surprised that there are various proposals for this "hyperlink style guide" format that we call manifest
  files, but once you realise how simple and basic these files are, it becomes obvious that it's trivial to just provide your style guide
  in both formats. It's probably even possible to create one JSON document that will work as both. This topic was also briefly discussed
  in the "Elevated Privileges" panel at EdgeConf (see minute ...):</p>
  <script>
  function showVideo(that) {
    that.innerHTML = '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/..." frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>';
  }
</script><h4 style="text-align: center" onclick="showVideo(this);">(show http://www.youtube.com/embed/...)</h4>
<p>Also, when you host your apps on 5apps, you will have a tool there for generating manifest files in all the (rapidly changing) formats.</p>

<h3>Review sites (was: App stores).</h3>
<p>What, so that's it? What about the whole thing with the app stores? How can people use my app if I don't put it into all the major app stores?</p>
<p>If you look at what app stores are and what they do, they are actually nothing more than review sites. Or maybe something in between a review
  site, a directory, a portal, and a search engine.</p>
<p>People go to an app store to find links to apps. Often, there will be a certain chain of trust at play there: the user trusts a certain review site
  (app store), and the review site has reviewed a certain app and not found any obvious malware in it, so the user can be a bit more certain that the
  app they launch is relatively trustworthy.</p>
<p>On our Indie Web sites, we can also all present lists of apps that we recommend. It will give our friends some more information about which apps might
  be worth trying out - a bit like a Retweet or a Like. All you need is a hyperlink.</p>
<p>Given that we have these hyperlink style guides we talked about earlier, let's try to create a bit of javascript that generates nice styleguide-compliant
  html on the fly. Here is one for Open Web App manifest files:</p>
<code><pre><!DOCTYPE html>
  <body>
    <div class="openwebapp">{
      icons: {
        128: "editor.png"
      }
    }</div>
  </body>
  <script src="//unhosted.org/adventures/12/launchbutton.js"></script>
</pre></code>
<p>If you include this into your website (you might want to copy the .js file and host it yourself), it will look something like this on your site:</p>

<div><img src="editor.png" /></div>
<p>As you can see, there is nothing stopping you from being an app store yourself! :) If you do this, then you should consider one thing: the value of
  a portal site is in the things that are not on it. The Apple platform is so popular <em>because</em> it is closed. The fact that "fart apps" are banned
  from the iOS App Store is what sets the quality level. Building a strict and prestigious portal site is not evil, it is a good thing. What is regrettable
  about the Apple platform is that it locks in hardware choice with software choice, and that it takes an extortionate profit margin, made possible
  by this monopoly situation.</p>
<p>But in itself, rejecting apps from your recommendation list, if it is done with the user's interests in mind, can lead to a sort of Michelin guide to
  unhosted web apps. You just have to look at the value of Debian ("if it's in Debian, then you can be sure it's stable"), to see a precedent of this in the
  free software world.</p>

<h3>System apps (was: packaged web apps).</h3>
<p>Last summer, Google decided to hardcode their Chrome Web Store into their Chrome Browser as the only allowed source of packaged web apps.</p>
<p>A packaged web app is a zip file containing the static files that make up an unhosted web app. It is essentially the same as  browser extension, add-on,
  or plugin in many ways. At first I was quite
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-apps/AZcMm413xww/discussion">upset about this</a>,
  but after thinking a lot more about app discovery, and watching the
  "elevated privileges" panel from EdgeConf recently, in my head I have assigned a different interpretation to this move.</p>
