<!-- marketing: Unhosted web apps to save the web. -->
<h3>The future.</h3>
<p>That's it, for the basics! With this episode, we completed the first part of our handbook. None of it is finished, but it should give a first direction for all the topics
we covered. I'll probably keep writing weekly blog posts here, I thought about maybe doing a more in-depth review of all kinds of background knowledge, like a sort of
textbook, but highlighting for each topic how it is relevant to unhosted web apps, and then linking to more detailed resources of all the related fields. Things like
encryption, DHTs, networking considerations, and other related technologies. After that, the third part would be about data domains (so basically all the remoteStorage
modules and all the sockethub platforms), then a part about building apps (discussing things like MVC), and then some assorted topics to round off. I've made a rough
estimation that the total handbook will be about 52 episodes, so I can take one year to fill it up week by week. :)</p>
<p>You may have followed the discussion about whether the No Cookie Crew is useful at all, or whether we should take a more pragmatic approach to dogfooding, concentrating
only on a few specific apps. I talked a lot about this with Nick, Basti, Niklas, Jan, Martin and Pavlik, and my conclusion is more or less that we'll move the strict
approach of the No Cookie Crew to the background a little bit, in favor of the more pragmatic dogfooding of apps like Litewrite and Dogtalk, but I think there is a place
for both approaches.</p>
<p>In terms of marketing, this means unhosted web apps have basically 3 or 4 concentric markets:
<ul>
<li>the strict No Cookie Crew market, a bit like Richard Stallman on free desktop software, or vegans on food, users in this market use only unhosted web apps for all their
computing needs, unless there is an explicit and identifiable need to break that principle.</li>
<li>the dogfooders market, people who are actively involved in developing unhosted web apps and their accompanying tools, and who will go through extra effort to use
unhosted web apps where they exist, with the specific purpose of helping those apps to get some first milage.</li>
<li>the early adopters market, people who will try out unhosted web apps, but who will not keep using them if they don't work well.</li>
<li>the general public, people who would probably not know the difference between an unhosted web app and a hosted one, and who would use unhosted web apps almost
"by accident", only if they are good apps by their own merit. Compare this for instance with the many users who use Firefox as their browser, but who don't know that
unlike the other major browsers, Firefox is published by a non-profit organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been talking about unhosted web apps for about two years now, and have been trying to build some useful remoteStorage-based apps for about one year.
We are still only at the beginning of unhosted web apps actually being used in production in any of these four markets. But the future looks bright. I think our movement
will keep growing both in number of developers involved, and in market reach of the unhosted web apps we develop. If you're interested in joining, then let us know!</p>
<p>We are always looking for more talented app developers. If you develop an unhosted web app, then you can add it to the
<a href="https://unhosted.org/apps/">examples page</a>; most of the apps mentioned on there have issue trackers on github, so you can submit bug reports there if you
have any problems using any of the apps, and if you have any questions or remarks in general, then just send them to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unhosted">forum</a>. Comments very welcome!</p>

      <p>The next episode will appear on Tuesday 9 April, 2013.</p>    </article>
