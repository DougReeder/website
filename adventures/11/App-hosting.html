<!-- app hosting: App hosting -->
<h3>Hosting is a telecommunications transport through space and time.</h3>
<p>This blogpost goes from me to you. I am writing this on a rainy saturday at the Bukit Bintang Starbucks in Kuala Lumpur.
You are reading this at a later time, at a different place. Hosting is just a transport that makes this possible.</p>
<p>We should not forget to design our internet applications with end-to-end principle in mind. If we want the internet to
empower people, then we should model all communication as taking place between people. This may disrupt a few assumptions that
you will have been fed during the age of hosted software.</p>

<h3>TLS is not secure unless combined with on-premises hosting</h3>
<p>TLS (formerly known as SSL, the technology behind <code>https://</code> URLs), stands for Transport Layer Security.
  It establishes a secure tunnel between the client and the server. Third parties can see that this tunnel exists, and roughly
  how much data travels through it, in which direction, and in which timing patterns, but it cannot see the unencrypted content
  that is being sent back and forth.</p>
<p>On top of TLS, the web uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) of the  Certificate Authority (CA) type. This system is well-known
to have its own problems, I'm not even talking about that. Purely the client-server security architecture in itself is an outdated
approach to security. It makes the assumption that the server is under the physical control of the person or organization publishing
the content. This was probably
true for 90% of the first websites, 20 years ago, but this percentage is probably closer to 10% (or even less) nowadays. This means
we should consider servers as intermediate hops, not end points, in the end-to-end communication model.</p>
<p>The problem is reasonably limited with co-located servers, where the data center hosting your server does not have the root password
to your server. In this case, any intrusion would at least be detectable, provided your co-located server has sensors for "case open"
and similar alerts.</p>
<p>But current-day Infrastructure-as-a-Service hosting provides virtualized servers, not physical ones. This is good because it allows
the IaaS provider to move your server around for load-balancing and live resizing, but it also means that the host system has access to
your private TLS key.</p>
<p>At a good IaaS company, only systems administrators under <a href="https://www.usenix.org/lisa/system-administrators-code-ethics">sysadmin oath</a>
and the management above them will have access to your server. Good managers at IaaS companies will only use their access to grant newly employed
sysadmins the necessary access, and apart from that maybe "a few" nation state governments.</p>
<p>You can tell a sysadmin because he or she will look away with a resolute gesture when you type your password in their presence. Even if it's the
password that you just asked them to reset. It is in a sysadmin's professional genes to be very precise about security and privacy. Still, TLS-hosted
websites
can no longer be sensibly called end-to-end secure in the age of web 2.0 and "the cloud", since the communicating parties (Alice and Bob, as we
often call them) do not have a secure channel between them.</p>
<p>So where does that leave us? Let's look specifically at app hosting.</p>

<h3>Wait, isn't hosting an unhosted web app a contradiction? :)</h3>
<p>Yes, of course, to be very precise, we should have called unhosted web apps 'statics-only web apps', since that is what we mean. But that just didn't
sound as intruiging. ;)</p>
<p>The web has no way of signing web apps. When hosting an unhosted ('statics-only') web app, we just serve each of the files that make up the app on a website,
and the only way to know whether you are seeing the web app that the developer wanted you to see, is if the server hosting it is under the physical control of
the developer. This doesn't often happen, of course (especially with nomadic developers!), so in most cases we will have to compromise a little bit on security.</p>
<p>In practice, security is always relative, and unless you mirror apps inside your LAN (more about that next week!),
in almost all cases we will have to trust at least one intermediate party: the app hoster. There is just one
exception to this: <a href="http://mailman.klaki.net/mailman/listinfo/revprotun">RevProTun</a> systems like Pagekite.</p>

<h3>RevProTun and Pagekite</h3>
<p>If you have a <a href="http://freedomboxfoundation.org/">FreedomBox</a> in your home, or you otherwise run a server that is always-on in a place that you physically
control, then you can put the unhosted web apps you publish on there, hosted on a simple statics server with TLS. You can use a nodejs script for this like the one we
described in <a href="/3/Setting-up-your-own-server.html">episode 3: setting up your own server</a>. Once have a TLS-enable website running on localhost, you can
publish your localhost to the world using a RevProTun service. A good example, personal friends of mine and also the main drivers behind the development of RevProTun,
are <a href="https://pagekite.net/">Pagekite</a>. You open a tunnel account with them, install their client app in a place where it can "see" the localhost service
you want to publish, and it will start delivering traffic from the outside world to it, functioning as a reverse proxy tunnel from your publically accessible hosting
origin to your locally ran TLS-secured statics hosting service.</p>
<p>RevProTun is an important part of how we want to add Indie Web hosting to FreedomBox. These are still future plans for which we always struggle to find time, but we
are determined to make a "freedom-compatible web hosting" solution like this available in a format that is also usable by end-users who may not want to know all the exact
details of how reverse proxy tunnels work. If you do want to know more about them, a good place to start is Bjarni's
<a href="https://pagekite.net/wiki/Floss/Video/">FOSDEM talk about Pagekite</a>.

<h3>How origins work</h3>
<p>Each unhosted web app should be hosted on its own "origin", meaning its own unique combination of scheme, host and port.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that your browser will shield off apps from each other, putting them each in one sandbox for each app.
If you would host two apps on the same origin, then your browser would allow these apps to access each other's data (for instance,
the data they store in localStorage), and then things would generally just become a big mess. So when hosting apps, host each one
on its own origin.</p>
<p>This also means that you don't want to publish any unhosted web apps directly on
<a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/08/some-love-for-javascript-applications-2/">https://dl.dropbox.com/</a>, or host more than
one app on each <a href="http://pages.github.com/">http://username.github.com/</a>, unless maybe if they are apps that will not handle
any user data (for short-lived and self-contained html5 games for instance, this security consideration may be less important).</p>
<p>So suppose you have your Indie Web domain name and you want to publish some unhosted web apps to the world.
For http hosting this is not so difficult to do: the scheme of each app's origin will always be 'http', but you can point as many subdomain hosts
to your IP address as you want; especially if you use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record">wild-card CNAME</a>. Then you can just use
<code>http://app1.example.com/</code>, <code>http://app2.example.com/</code>, etcetera as origins for the apps you host.</p>
<p>If you want to do this properly however, and get at least the amount of security we can despite your server probably being hosted on insecure
IaaS infrastructure, then you should always host apps on https. This brings into play the limitations of which origins your TLS cert will work on.
Unless you own a wild-card certificate, you will probably only have two hosts, probably "something.example.com" and its parent, "example.com".</p>
<p>But luckily, origins are defined by scheme, host, <em>and port</em>. This means you can host tens of thousands of apps using the same cert; simply
use origins like "https://apps.yourdomain.com:42001/", "https://apps.yourdomain.com:42002/", etcetera.</p>

<h3>Using SNI to host multiple TLS cert</h3>
<p>Five or ten years ago SNI didn't exist yet, and you had to get a dedicated IP address for every TLS cert you want to host on an IP address.
  Until recently I thought this was still the case, but as Bjarni explained to me the other day, this is now a resolved problem.
  <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_npn_and_sni">Using</a>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Browsers_with_support_for_TLS_server_name_indication.5B5.5D">SNI</a>, you can host as many TLS certs
  on one virtual server as you like, without having to request extra IPv4 addresses and paying the extra fee for them. I haven't switched to this myself yet, since
  I have so far published my unhosted web apps apps all through 5apps. I do have two IPv4 addresses on my server, one for nodejs and one for apache,
  and your server will need two IP addresses to do STUN in a few episodes from now (yes! we're going to play with PeerConnection and WebRTC soon!).</p>

<h3>5apps</h3>
<p>There is a very cool Berlin start-up, again, also personal friends of mine, called <a href="https://5apps.com/">5apps</a>. They specialize in app
hosting for unhosted web apps. You may have seen them mentioned on our <a href="https://unhosted.org/tools/">tools</a> page, and most of our
<a href="https://unhosted.org/apps/">featured apps</a> are hosted on 5apps. The will soon be launching https hosting (using a wildcard TLS cert for
*.5apps.com), and deploying your app to their hosting gives you a number of advantages over home-backing your own app hosting. They will automatically
generate an appcache manifest for your app (more about this below), resize your icon for the various favicon formats for browsers as well as for instance
  iPad devices, and generate all the various file formats for submitting your app to various review sites and app stores (more about that next week).</p>
<p>On top of that, they offer a number of things which "make your app nice", like browser compatibility detection, a user feedback widget, and JavaScript
  minification. Statics hosting is a mature market; you can find various companies who specialize in it. But the advantage of 5apps over for instance
  Amazon S3 is that 5apps specialize specifically in the hosting of your unhosted web apps. And like with Pagekite, I can personally confirm that
  they are nice people, who care about re-decentralizing the web. :)</p>
<h3>Caching and the end-to-end principle</h3>
<p>Appcache is a way for a web app to tell a browser to pro-actively cache parts of it. It is still a relatively new technology, and if you want to know
  how it got its nickname of 'appdouche cachebag', you should definitely watch at least the first 10 minutes of this video:</p>
<script>
  function showVideo(that) {
    that.innerHTML = '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Oic22dQMRXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>';
  }
</script><h1 onclick="showVideo(this);">(show http://www.youtube.com/embed/Oic22dQMRXQ)</h1>
<p>One good thing about appcache is that, like the browser's http cache, it works end-to-end. The web of documents was designed with caching of GET requests
  in mind. A lot of hosted web apps will cache the content produced by their webservers using something like <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">squid</a>
  or <a href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/">varnish</a>, behind an https offloading layer. Often, this will be outsourced to a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>. After that, in theory researchers thought that multicasting would become big on the
  internet, but this didn't really happen, at least not for web content. Instead, content providers like youtube and CDNs like Akamai extended their tentacles
  right onto inside the exchange hubs where they peer with ISPs. In a sense, we have the multicast backbone that academia tried to develop, but it's privately
  owned by companies like the two I just mentioned.</p>
<p>So once the content reaches the ISP, it will often be cached again by the ISP, before it is delivered to the Last Mile. None of this works when you use end-to-end
  encryption, of course. Multicasting traffic is a lot like deduplicating content-addressable content (only harder because of the time constraints), and as one commenter
  said about a company that claimed it could do that, there's a choice between end-to-end encryption, deduping, and making sense: you can only choose any two. :)</p>
<p>This means that on https, any request that misses cache on your device, will have to go all the way to the app hoster. We will look at distributing "huge" apps
  (e.g., several Gigabytes) next week, but in general, the thing you will want to use is appcache.</p>
<h3>the appcache discussion</h3>
<p>First of all, when you use appcache you should only cache the "shell" of your entire app, so all its layout and functionality,
  but not any content it may include (this is also explained in the video above). For caching content that may be relevant this week, but already replaced next week,
  you may want to implement your own custom caching system inside your app, using for instance <a href="http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/">LawnChair</a> or
  <a href="http://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a>.</p>
<p>As is also mentioned in the video, Mozilla and Google are cooperating to 'fix appcache'. There will probably be a more powerful API with less surprises.</p>
<p>The result of using appcache though, once you get used to refreshing the page 3 times after deploying changes to your app, is amazing. Your apps will Just Work,
  even if there is no wifi connection. And if there is a wifi connection, then they will load very fast, much faster of course than if you wouldn't cache them.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think this covers most of the topics you have to keep in mind for app hosting. Next week, we will look at how app stores, packaging, and mirroring work
  for unhosted web apps. See you then! :)</p>
