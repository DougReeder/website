      <h2>14. Peer-to-peer communication</h2>

<!-- p2p: Peer-to-peer communication -->
<h3>Routability</h3>
<p>To establish communication between two devices, one of them generally has to have a way to find the other. In a client/server situation,
it is generally the client who finds the server starting from a domain name, through a DNS lookup, and then establishes a tcp connection going
out from the client, routed over IP, and into a port on which the server is listening. This requires the server to be listening on a port which
was agreed beforehand (probably a default port for a certain protocol, or one included alongside the server's domain name in a URL), and requires
the server to be online at the time the client initiates the communication, on the IP address advertised in DNS.</p>
<p>If we were to use this system for peer-to-peer communication (the situation in which the caller and the callee have a similar device setup),
then the callee would have to use dynamic DNS to keep their IP address up to date, and would need to be able to open a public port on their device.
While the first is often possible, the second is often not; especially when you're on the move.</p>
<p>An easy solution for this is to route all incoming traffic to an unhosted web app through sockethub.</p>

<h3>Setting up a simple chat app</h3>
<p>We already used Webfinger to announce the location of a user's remoteStorage server. We can easily add an additional line to the user's webfinger record,
announcing a URL on which the user may be contacted. This would probably be an end-point on your personal server, not directly on your device, since your
device is usually not publically addressable. But using the webrtc platform of the <a href="https://github.com/michielbdejong/sockethub">adventures fork</a>
of sockethub, an unhosted web app can instruct sockethub to open a public WebSocket on a pre-configured port.</p>
<p>Any traffic coming into this WebSocket will then
transparently be forwarded to the unhosted web app, and reversely the unhosted web app can send commands to sockethub that will be forwarded back to the contacting
peer. In that sense it's very much like Pagekite - a sort of reverse proxy tunnel.</p>
<p>I wrote a demo of this setup in <a href="http://social.unhosted.5apps.com/chat.html">chat.html</a>, a small example script that allows you to tell sockethub that
you are online and willing to take incoming calls, and also to check if a certain webfinger user (currently hardcoded to me) is online, and chat with them if they are.</p>
<p>So this simple demo app uses webfinger and sockethub to implement a simple text chat. It's still not very usable, since sockethub was not designed to listen on ports;
this means you can have only one chat conversation at a time. But we'll work on that to get it working as a proper chat app, with an addressbook and everything.</p>
<p>Right now there is also no way to claim an identity in this chat; every caller appears as an anonymous peer. You would have to tell the callee with words who you are,
and also convince them with words that actually you are who you say you are. Both these things could be automated, for instance the sockethub server could accept
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-prodromou-dialback-00.txt">DialBack</a> authentication.  Dialback is a work-in-progress and currently in expired state,
but it's a very simple way
to find out if a request is from the person it claims to be from, without needing to implement any cryptography.</p>
<h3>Using PeerConnection</h3>
<p>In a sense, this chat app is not really peer-to-peer, since all traffic goes through the sockethub server of the callee. But that's at the same time an important point
to make in general: unless you use a distributed hash table, a peer-to-peer call always starts with a request to a publically addressable server. However, using the new
PeerConnection technology, it is possible to upgrade to a shortcut route, once first contact has been made. I attempted to write a
<a href="http://social.unhosted.5apps.com/friends.html">caller</a> and <a href="http://social.unhosted.5apps.com/me.html">callee</a> script to demo this, but ran into some
problems where the both Firefox Nightly and Chrome give an error which I wasn't expecting from the documentation.</p>
<p>I will update this episode as soon as I get this working. This is all still quite new ground to explore. The main point I want to make and repeat is that PeerConnection
is a way to establish a shortcut route between two peers, once first contact has <em>already</em> been established. This will lead to lower latency, and will enable the
use of end-to-end encryption between the two peers. So it's really quite valuable. But it is not a serverless protocol.</p>
<p>Eventually, when we get this working, we will be able to replace Skype, and use an unhosted web app (with a little help from sockethub) instead. Next week we will have
a look at one last piece in the puzzle to complete what I think of as the first part of this handbook for the No Cookie Crew:
after having dumped GMail, Dropbox, Google Docs, Spotify, Facebook,
Twitter, Flickr, and with this episode also having opened the way for dumping Skype,
the last cookied platform we will need in order to cover "the basics" is github.</p>
